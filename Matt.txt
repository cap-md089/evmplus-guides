CDR Rioux,

I realize that this text is unsolicited, however I wanted to share with you a brief update on the Curriculum Alignment Project at USNTPS. Personally, I am so grateful for the opportunity to be involved and thank you for your leadership and commitment to the project.

This past November, I was able to complete a comprehensive review of the Fixed Wing Curriculum, to include revised syllabi and pre-requisite course mapping for 128 academic and flight events.  By default, this covered the common courses shared between the Airborne and Unmanned Systems, and Rotary Wing Curriculum.

In addition, we have worked to streamline the on-boarding/indoctrination courses and schedule, while enhancing the and formalizing the courseware and guiding documents for students and instructors.

Finally, I have written a white paper for USNTPS detailing the need and rationale for an diverse Curriculum Review and Standards Board, much like a Board of Visitors often brought in by tertiary academic institutions to enhance quality control, provide recommendations and afford greater insight into current military, academic and industry practices/needs.  This paper was submitted to John Oâ€™Connor (USNTPS CAO) and I believe is under consideration.

Much of the supporting files and data collection methods I am using should support any effort to aggregate and use that data in a digital environment, like an LMS or CMS.

In conclusion, the effort continues, and we are continuing to make progress.  

I hope you are doing well, and thank you again for your support.

Respectfully,
Matt Weeden




Matt,
First off, I apologize for the extended delay in my response.

Thank you very much for reaching out to me.  I am very happy to hear that you continue to be involved in the project and seem to be able to see it to fruition!  USNTPS is a great institution and the curriculum has needed a major overhaul for a while.
